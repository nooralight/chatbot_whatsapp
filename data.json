The top layer in older automobile dashboards is usually made from polyvinyl chloride, commonly called PVC. PVC can crack after a few years of exposure to sunlight and heat if not properly maintained and protected. The dashboards of older cars, especially classics, tend to become brittle and crack after many years of exposure to the sun.  1. Ultraviolet Light The most common cause of dashboard cracks is exposure to ultraviolet light. Ultraviolet light is harmful to the chemical components of plastics such as PVC. Over time, ultraviolet light can evaporate oils and break down the plastic molecules. If regularly exposed to ultraviolet light, the dashboard plastic will become dry and crack.  2. Heat Extended exposure to heat, such as parking the car in the open and exposing the dash to sunlight through the windshield, can break down the chemical molecules in the dashboard. The interior of a car can exceed 100 F on a sunny day after about one hour of exposure. Dashboards that have a dry, dusty or powdery appearance have been damaged by heat and ultraviolet light.  3. Repairs Small cracks can be repaired. The entire dashboard must be replaced if the cracks are deep and long. The dashboard should be replaced if the cracks have a spider web appearance. Filling the crack with silicon or using a dashboard crack repair kit, available at most auto parts stores, is a temporary fix. The crack will probably reappear in a couple of years, especially if the dashboard is exposed to heat and sunlight.  4. Prevention Prevent cracks in a dashboard by protecting it from ultraviolet light and extreme heat. Park the car inside a garage or in a shady location. Use a windshield screen or a car cover year-round to block sunlight and prevent damage. Apply a moisturizing treatment to the dashboard to prevent the PVC from drying out. Select a treatment that contains a sunscreen to block ultraviolet light."}, {"tag": "217", "patterns": "What are the things that i should look out for if i am considering to renew COE for my vehicle?", "responses": "There are several things you should know before you decide to renew your COE -   1. You will have to forgo your PARF Rebate The Parf Rebate is the the amount of money you get back from the Government once you deregister your car, and is also known as the scrap value. This is something to consider if your car's PARF value is fairly significant.  2. You will need to pay the PQP This is the moving average of the COE prices over the last three months. Your PQP will be based on the respective category that your vehicle belongs in.   3. You can renew your COE for 5 years,  but that makes it non-renewable. There is an option of renewing your car's COE for just five years instead of 10, for which you simply pay half of the PQP at the point of renewal. This might be a more financially sound option for those who may not have as much ready cash for a full 10-year COE renewal, but bear in mind that if you opt for a five-year renewal, you will be unable to extend the car's lifespan any further once the COE's tenure is up. A 10-year COE can be renewed in perpetuity, however. Do take note that commercial vehicles have a statutory lifespan of 20 years, and you cannot renew its COE for any further than that.  4. There is an additional surcharge on Road Tax for cars over 10 years. This amount is chargeable at an amount of 10 percent over the car's regular road tax rate per annum, up to a maximum of 50 percent. For a car with a large capacity engine, the increase in costs can grow to be quite significant.  5. You will suffer less depreciation on your car after renewal Renewing your car's COE will always be more financially accessible than buying a new car, as you'll only pay the cost of the new COE. Therefore, the resulting depreciation over the next 10 years will be significantly less than if you've purchased a new car.  6. You will forfeit the remaining balance of your COE rebate upon renewal Aside from the PARF value, the LTA also offers a rebate on any 'unused' value of your current COE if you deregister it before the full 10-year tenure is up. However, should you renew your COE before it reaches its expiry date, you will forfeit any COE rebate that you are eligible for. It is for this reason that most people tend to renew their COEs very close to the expiry date, or even on the day itself, in order to minimise the 'loss' of this rebate.   7. Your renewed COE car is still eligible for COE rebates upon deregistration While a car with a revalidated COE is no longer eligible for PARF rebates, it is still eligible for a rebate on the renewed COE. What this means is that, should you scrap or deregister your car before your renewed COE is up, you will be refunded the pro-rated amount of the COE remaining.  For example, if you renew your car's COE for 10 years at $50,000, and you decide to scrap it exactly five years later, you will get back $25,000 in COE rebates upon deregistration. It is a point worth considering as it means your COE-renewed car does have some residual value even after renewal.  8. You can take a loan for COE renewal There are banks and financial institutions that allow you to take loans to renew your COE. They aren't that common, but a quick search reveals that some do offer loan quantum of up to 70 percent over seven years, at an interest rate of 3.25 percent, for COE re-validations. Financial institutions, such as Hong Leong Finance, Tokyo Century Leasing and United Overseas Bank, may offer different rates so it pays to do your research.   9. You can get comprehensive insurance coverage for a COE car A common myth is that COE-renewed cars (or COE cars) are ineligible for comprehensive insurance coverage. In actual fact, it is actually possible to get comprehensive insurance for such cars, although it is indeed harder to source. However, if you take a loan for COE renewal from some finance companies, they may require that you obtain comprehensive insurance cover for your car as part of their terms and conditions."}, {"tag": "218", "patterns": "What if I fail to submit disposal documents of a de-registered vehicle?", "responses": "Offenders who fail to submit disposal documents as proof that the vehicle has been scrapped, exported, or sent to EPZ for storage, within a month from its de-registration may be prosecuted in Court, and face a maximum Court fine of $2,000 or 3 months' imprisonment.

Cons \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Manuals require skill to drive and might cause you to kill your car on steep slopes if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re an inexperienced driver. Stop-and-go traffic becomes painful with a stick shift because of frequent shifting, and cars with manual transmissions are also typically harder to find than automatics, as more models offer automatics.

Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the main reason why PARF and COE car prices differ:  A PARF car hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been de-registered before its 10-year depreciation period has ended. This makes it eligible for both the COE and PARF Rebate, which ranges from 50% \\xe2\\x80\\x93 75% of the Additional Registration Fee (ARF) paid on the vehicle. A COE car is not eligible for the PARF Rebate because the owner chose to pay the Prevailing Quota Premium (PQP) for 5 or 10 more years more instead of de-registering the vehicle. This means that upon de-registration, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll only receive the COE Rebate. There are many other differences between PARF and COE cars that contribute to both their upfront and long-term cost, such as:   The Down Payment The down payment makes up the biggest chunk of your upfront cost when buying a used car. And with the latest MAS car loan restrictions, the amount you can borrow is reduced \\xe2\\x80\\x93 meaning you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to pay a larger down payment.  So your down payment will depend on the following:  If the Open Market Value (OMV) of your vehicle is $20,000 or less, your maximum Loan-to-Value is 60% \\xe2\\x80\\x93 meaning you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to make a 40% down payment. Almost all COE cars will fit into this category. If the Open Market Value (OMV) of your vehicle is more than $20,000, your maximum Loan-to-Value is 50% \\xe2\\x80\\x93 meaning you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to make a 50% down payment. Most PARF cars will fit into this category.    The Rebates The rebates associated with both PARF and COE cars is where used cars get much of their value from.

Even though the driver may argue that the vehicle is the dealership\\xe2\\x80\\x99s property and thus is under their jurisdiction, the fact remains that transferred temporary responsibility has been transferred to the test driver during the test drive. That means that the test driver must deal with the consequences of the accident through the dealer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s policy and bear any ancillary costs.  Depending on the nature of the accident, the dealer might suggest for the offending customer to purchase the vehicle, even though they are not legally obliged to do so. By doing so, the repairs for the vehicle will be your responsibility \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you are now the owner of the car!  Generally, accidents that occur during a test drive are usually fairly minor. If the damages are pretty substantial then the right thing to do will be to absorb the damages and purchase the car. If the damage is too great, however, it would be unwise to purchase the car (or what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s left of the car) \\xe2\\x80\\x93 do not let the dealership coerce you into making this one-sided deal.  What about the dealership\\xe2\\x80\\x99s insurance coverage? Any dealer worth his or her weight in salt who sends a potential customer on a test drive will compel the test driver to sign forms, which transfers responsibility of all damages to the vehicle to the driver.  If the car is involved in a serious accident, or if the test-driver refuses to purchase the vehicle, the dealership will invoke their insurance\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coverage. However, the test-driver will still be required to pay a set amount for the damages he caused, usually calculated by the amount of deductibles that was set aside for the test-driven vehicle.  Using the test-driver\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own insurance coverage Often, the dealership will suggest for the test driver to make a claim from their own policy rather than from of the dealers. This move is not unprecedented, especially if the test-driver was alone in the test-driven vehicle at the time of the accident.  However, the test-driver should think this through very carefully and consult with their insurance company before making any commitments. They will have to ensure that their insurance coverage extends to vehicles that are not owned by them. A baseless claim may even be viewed by insurance companies as fraudulent claims, and will result in even more trouble for the test-driver.  Still, there are many smaller dealers that do not purchase insurance for their vehicles, because of the hefty premiums and deductibles they will have to shoulder. This is where you should think twice before even entering this dealership \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if the dealership cannot even spend to protect its fleet of vehicles, what makes it reliable?  Even if it means walking away from your dream car, you should not take the risk of driving a car that is completely uninsured \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re lucky, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be able to use your own insurance coverage in the case of a test-drive accident. Even then, such measures are unnecessary if the dealer has coverage for its fleet of vehicles.  The Final Word On Crashing During A Test Drive Being involved in an accident during a test drive must be everyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nightmare, but this nightmare can be cut short if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re dealing with an honest, reputable dealer. However, there are always a few black sheeps in any industry who will force you into the purchase of the damaged vehicle because of the lack of insurance coverage on their fleet of vehicles.  As such, when test-driving the vehicle of your choice, the test driver must insist in finding out whether the dealer has purchased insurance coverage for the test-driven car.  Car insurance that covers potential owners in the event of a test-drive accident is the least of what car dealerships can do to protect their own vehicles.

This represents a more stringent inspection regime as compared to that for normal vehicles, which are typically inspected once every one or two years, depending on their age and type. Any owner who does not comply with the inspection regime is guilty of an offence and can be fined up to $1,000 or jailed for up to three months on conviction for the first offence. On conviction for a second or subsequent offence of failing to comply, the maximum penalty will be doubled.  3 The enhanced inspection regime will complement existing penalties to deter motorists from modifying their vehicle engines or exhaust systems illegally. Any person who is convicted of an illegal modification can be fined up to $2,000 or jailed for up to three months, for the first offence. Repeat offenders can be fined up to $5,000 or jailed up to six months. In addition, if a vehicle is found with a tampered engine, it will need to be deregistered and the owner may not be granted the rebates for the residual Certificates of Entitlement (COE) and Preferential Additional Registration Fee (PARF), if any.  Consequences of Illegal Modifications  4 The Land Transport Authority (LTA) takes a serious view of such illegal modifications, as an illegally modified engine or exhaust system can create serious safety and environmental hazards. Once a vehicle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s engine or exhaust system is modified without due certification and approval, the existing vehicle components may not be able to handle the increased power or speed. Such modifications may also affect the durability and reliability of a vehicle.  Approved Modifications  5 Currently, motorists may choose to legally install after-market exhaust systems that are certified to be suitable for the specific vehicle make and model. These exhaust systems which are specifically designed and engineered for a particular vehicle make and model will have undergone testing, either by the vehicle manufacturer or by independent test laboratories, to ensure compliance with internationally recognised standards.  6 More information on vehicle modification guidelines can be found at LTA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s One.Motoring website at LTA Information & Guidelines/Common Vehicle Modifications & Vehicle-Related Offences.

Most of today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cars, with the exception of high-performance engines, are tuned to run on regular unleaded fuel with little advantage to be gained by using premium. Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the skinny:  Your engine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cylinders hold a mixture of gas and air. The cylinder compresses that mixture very quickly and your spark plug ignites it. That little explosion (like a cannon firing) is the combustion in an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinternal combustion engine\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and creates the energy to make your car go. The octane of a gasoline tells you how much compression it can stand before it ignites spontaneously. The higher the octane, the higher the compression it can take.  Most cars have an 8:1 compression ratio, which is perfect for regular unleaded gas. That means the cylinder is compressing the gas/air mixture at just the right rate.  If the gas isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a high-enough grade for the compression rate of the cylinder, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll ignite early, before the spark from the spark plug.

Several factors determine how long your battery will last, for example weather conditions, vehicle type and driving habits.  There are, however, several key pointers you can utilise to help increase the life expectancy of your car battery.  WHY IS MY BATTERY FLAT?  Make sure to check all of the electrical connections and ensure the battery is kept clean and dry. If corrosion has built up over time, baking soda in a water solution and an old toothbrush is ideal to clean the battery terminals. Just make sure to remove the negative terminal first. When reapplying the terminals, connect the positive terminal first. Frequent, short car trips contribute to an earlier lifespan for car batteries. It takes roughly eight hours of continuous driving for the alternator to fully charge the battery.  If the battery infrequently receives a full charge, strong crystalline deposits can form on the negative plates and consequently prevents the battery from charging properly \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this is called sulphation. If short car trips are a part of your daily routine, avoid using electric auxiliary controls unnecessarily \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this will prolong the lifespan of the battery and also save on fuel.  If your car isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t in use for long periods of time, removing the negative battery connection during periods of non-use assists in the longevity of your battery.  Just make sure to reconnect the terminal before attempting to start the car. The electrolyte (acid/water) solution levels may be low. If your battery is not maintenance-free, you may need to adjust the solution levels. If the levels are low, be sure to use the necessary safety precautions when you are handling battery acid. Only use distilled water, or you will damage the battery."}, {"tag": "340", "patterns": "Is my car battery able to be used for recycle?", "responses": "Your local auto garage or recycling centre will take your car battery, usually for a small fee.

You should avoid using fuel with an octane number that is lower than what your engine is built for, as this will result in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cknocking\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Knocking occurs when the fuel detonates in the engine combustion chamber before it is supposed to, resulting in poor performance and may even ruin the engine.   A ruined engine will obviously shorten the car's lifespan and will burn a hole through your pockets due to maintenance and repairs.

Can you advise me?", "responses": "First factor to consider is the age of the car. You may find that cars with their COE expiring in 1 or 2 years tend to be cheaper. But bear in mind that these cars are 8 to 9 years old. Their mechanical structure and engines might not work as perfectly as how they did 8 to 9 years ago. This increases the possibility of the cars breaking down or malfunctioning. It may result in you not spending a lot of money in buying the car, but spending more money for maintenance and repairs instead.  Second factor to consider is the mileage of the car. A 3 year old car does not mean that it has a lower mileage than a 7 year old car. The mileage really depends on the usage frequency of the previous owner. Cars with higher mileage tends to have its fair share of wear and tear. This situation could grow worse if the previous owner do not maintain the car appropriately. Getting a low mileage car is a better option when buying a used car as you know that the car is not used very often. Thus the engines and all might still be in good condition.   One tip that we could provide you is to inspect the car's engine, mechanicals and electronics physically before buying the car. Ensure that they are all in good condition. It may not be in perfect condition but good condition cars are a better bet than having a car with poor engine. In this kind of situation, your mechanic will be your bestfriend that you could trust.

To help manage business costs, the Road Traffic Act provides an exception for owners and hirers of goods vehicles, including goods vans, to use their vehicles to transport their workers to and from their places of work or business so long as they comply with various safety requirements.   Goods vans are generally not used for the mass transport of workers for commute trips and are observed to be used more by the specialist trade for the transport of goods or equipment as well as some attendants. We recognise that there could be some occasions where the owner or hirer of the goods van needs to use his van to transport his workers. As part of the safety requirement, the owner or hirer of the goods van must display a Maximum Passenger Capacity (MPC) label on the vehicle indicating the maximum number of workers that can be transported on the cargo deck of the vehicle. The MPC label serves as a reminder to the vehicle owner, hirer and driver of the maximum number of workers that the vehicle can carry on the cargo deck of the vehicle as well as facilitates enforcement against errant employers. When determining the maximum passenger capacity of a cargo deck, the usable deck area should not include the area occupied by any permanent fixtures on the cargo deck such as cranes, toolboxes, etc. If goods are also transported, the number of persons should be reduced accordingly. The MPC is calculated based on the total unoccupied deck area divided by the area of 0.372 square metres (4 square feet) per person, round down to the nearest whole number. The vehicle is not allowed to exceed its loading capacity or travel faster than the vehicle speed limit of 60 km/h or the stipulated road speed limit.

If you momentarily look, say, at the white line on the side of the road, you would still be able to see what you need to with your periphery vision.  b) Adjust your side mirrors properly to minimise glare from the vehicles behind you. Here's how: While sitting in the driver's seat, lean to the right and rest your head against the window; adjust the driver-side mirror so you can just see your rear fender. Next, lean to the left so your head is in the center of the vehicle; adjust the passenger-side mirror so the left rear fender is just visible.  c) Make sure all glasses on your vehicle (the headlights, windshield, windows and mirrors) are clean.

Vehicles that contribute significantly to any one pollutant should not be incentivised under VES. By basing the rebate/surcharge on the worst-performing pollutant, only vehicles with low tailpipe emissions across all pollutants will be incentivised.

Source: LTA"}, {"tag": "574", "patterns": "Why should pollutants other than carbon dioxide (CO2) be added to the Vehicular Emissions Scheme (VES)? Why are these other pollutants chosen?", "responses": "Based on empirical data and academic literature, vehicles of different technologies emit different amounts of pollutants. Petrol vehicles tend to produce more carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HC), whilst diesel vehicles are more carbon efficient, but produce more nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM). The inclusion of various types of pollutants in the scheme allows for a more holistic evaluation of vehicle models and encourages the purchase of cleaner car and taxi models that not only emit lower levels of CO2, but also lower levels of other pollutants in order to further improve our ambient air quality.    The 5 pollutants were selected and based on our existing type approval emissions standards for new vehicles. Under the VES, the emission standards include pollutants such as HC, CO, NOx, PM and CO2.  The VES rebate or surcharge will be determined by the worst performing pollutant. The National Environment Agency (NEA) requires all new vehicles to be tested for their emissions.

Moisture can cause brake rotors, which are made of unfinished metal, to rust as quickly as overnight. This is normal, which can lead to a grinding noise, and will last until the surface rust is removed. Hard braking creates significant heat, which can glaze brake pads and cause a squeaky brake noise.

Oil Drain Plug: This can be worn out, misaligned, or loose as well. It can be found underneath your car. If this is the cause of leakage, there will be fresh oil around it or dripping on the side of it.  3. Oil Filler Cap: If not closed properly, or broken, pressure created by the engine can cause the oil to spill out.  4. The Oil Pan: It can be damaged when run over debris on the road. This causes dents which compromises the oil drain plug causing leakage.  5. The Valve Gasket: This is a seal that joins the two main metal parts of the engine. If your car is old, or hasn't been serviced in a while, then this may be the cause of leakage. It gets damaged due to the buildup of sludge causing too much pressure on it.

Typically, an interested buyer is only able to get a 60 or 70% car loan from the bank, depending on the Open Market Value (OMV) of the vehicle. If the OMV is below $20,000, you'll be able to get a 70% loan. If it is above $20,000, you can only get a 60% loan.  Let's say you purchase a $100,000 car with an OMV of $19,000. You will receive a bank loan of $70,000. The remaining $30,000 will have to be paid by cash. Most banks offer an interest rate of 2.78% p.a and the maximum loan tenure is at 7 years.  Here's the formula to calculate the interest base on the information above:   Interest = $70,000 x 2.78% x 7 years = $13,622  Therefore, your total repayment amount is $70,000 + $13,622 = $83,622. Your monthly instalment will be  $83,6227 / 84 months (7 years) = $995.50.  Kindly note that this is the maximum amount that the bank will loan you.

You can use either of these 2 ways to check if your car battery is in good conditions: A) with a voltmeter by following these steps:  1. Turn off your ignition.  2. Remove the battery\\'s positive terminal cover. Check and clean the battery terminals.  3. Connect your voltmeter\\'s positive lead to the positive terminal on your battery. The positive lead on a voltmeter is usually red.  4. Attach the negative voltmeter lead to the negative battery terminal.  5. Check the voltmeter. If your battery is in good condition, the voltage should be between 12.4 and 12.7 volts. - A reading lower than 12.4 volts means that your battery needs to be charged. - If the reading is lower than 12.2 volts, \"trickle charge\" the battery, which is a slow charge. And then re-check. - If the reading is over 12.9 volts, you have excessive voltage. Turn on the high beams to remove excessive voltage surface charge. Over voltage may be an indication the alternator is over charging the battery.  B) By cranking the engine by following these steps:  1. \"Crank\" the engine by turning the ignition until the starter engages and hold for 2 seconds. Have someone crank the engine while you check battery voltage drop.  2. At the time of the crank, check the reading of the Power Probe. It should not go below 9.6 volts. - A battery with a volt reading less than 9.6 volts means the battery is sulfated and not holding/accepting the charge."}, {"tag": "1876", "patterns": "How to delete cars on motorist app", "responses": "Hi Ryan, do contact us via the Chat function in the Motorist App, we will be able to assist you from there!

Paint issue - Some may have patches, whether it's just a slightly different shade, a variance of the shine or completely mismatching colors between the various different body panels, it all points to a car that had its bodywork repaired. Still, do double check with the seller.  2. Replaced parts - Many drivers turn to a form of filler to fill in a dent or crack on a car. Whilst filler can help some dents vanish with barely a blemish left, the mixture can actually harm the body of the car if it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mixed properly. The filler mix can cause cracking around the dented area, discoloration and a weakened area that is vulnerable to general wear and tear in the long term.  3. Car doesn't drive straight - When a car couldn't drive straight it means the alignment is off. In the worst case scenario, it may even be a car that has a bent chassis that is impossible to be properly aligned. Never purchase such a vehicle without demanding for a realignment to be done, if possible, and ascertain that the issue has been rectified.  4. Visible creased panels - The malleable steel sheets, which make up most of a car, could crease upon the impact of a collision, and a proper repair job would see to it that the body of the car is straightened as much as possible. However, a shoddy repair job might leave concealed areas such as the boot floor or sections in the engine bay still visibly creased.  5. Unevenly worn tyres - Tyre treads that are worn on one side more than the other could be an indicator that the car has be in an accident. Check the framework surrounding the tyres, as well as the rims to see if they are scraped or dented. It could be a sign that the car has been involved in something serious."}, {"tag": "1903", "patterns": "What do I need to get a bike reloan?", "responses": "Hi Haziq!

Both insurance & workshop mentioned such case is very common in Singapore. I don't really understand the logic. Does that mean the faulter gets scot free? And police cannot do anything?
